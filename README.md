# Sherlock üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

During the the [Flutter Munich Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/flutter-munich/events/286824029/) I'm talking about building your own error monitoring solution. The resulting library is called sherlock. Read the talk description below.


## The magic behind error tracking - How to build your own custom solution

Error monitoring software can look like magic, just call some initialization code and somehow you get insightful error reports on a dashboard.
But how does this magic work behinde the scenes? How can you hook into error handlers and turn those errors into insightful error reports?
In this talk I'm going to show you, that it's not as hard as you might think.

I will post the slides and code later in this repo.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ue_man), where I post my thoughts on Flutter and the world, and also on GitHub, where you can see my open source contributions and software. I hope you'll find it interesting.
